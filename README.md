This code sample was designed to demonstrate the 'read data' functionalities of using OGR/GDAL functions with python (fyi - the functions used here are similar to the 'Describe' functions in the ESRI geoprocessing model).
 
To download OGR/GDAL & the python bindings (for the ver. of python you are using) go here:

* [OGR/GDAL Mirror](http://www.gisinternals.com/sdk/ "OGR/GDAL Mirror")

For more information regarding how to set the Environmental variables for your system, go here:

Results from this exercise was shared by Arielle Simmons at the Spring 2013 NEARC (Amherst, MA): [Bridging GIS Environments : using FWTools, OGR/GDAL, and Google Maps/Fusion Tables API](http://www.slideshark.com/Landing.aspx?pi=zFhzjBv13zC7LNz0 "Bridging GIS Environments : using FWTools, OGR/GDAL, and Google Maps/Fusion Tables API").
